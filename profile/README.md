## üöÄ Overview

GeoTarget Stack for RapidWeaver is a powerful web design add-on that allows you to tailor the content your website displays **based on the visitor‚Äôs geographic location**. Rather than serving every visitor the same text, images or sections, this stack gives you the control to deliver:

- country-specific headlines, banners, or promos  
- state or province-based offers or messages  
- city-level content variations  

Imagine showing different welcome messages to European visitors than to US visitors, or displaying local store hours depending on the visitor‚Äôs state. GeoTarget Stack dynamically detects the visitor‚Äôs country, state or even city (where possible) and shows or hides content modules accordingly.

It‚Äôs particularly useful for businesses with multiple regional branches, promoters running local campaigns, or web designers building multilingual or region-aware sites. Instead of clumsy if-else CSS hacks or heavy JavaScript, this stack keeps your project clean: content visibility is managed inside RapidWeaver using this stack module, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.

Additionally, GeoTarget Stack supports fallback content: for visitors whose location can‚Äôt be determined (e.g. due to privacy tools), you can specify default content so your site still delivers a coherent experience rather than blank regions. It also offers preview/test mode so you can preview how content will appear for different geographic regions while building your site. This improves both workflow and confidence in what visitors will see. With GeoTarget Stack, your site‚Äôs content becomes smarter, more relevant, and more personalized without extra overhead.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**What happens if a visitor‚Äôs location can't be found?**  
You can specify fallback/default content to display when location is unavailable.

**Can I test how content appears in different locations?**  
Yes ‚Äî preview/test mode lets you simulate visitor locations to check content behavior.

**Is there performance penalty for using this stack?**  
Minimal ‚Äî content control logic is lightweight; once page is loaded, the visitor only gets what they need.

**Can I combine region-rules?**  
Yes, you can set multiple conditions (e.g. country AND state) to precisely control content visibility.
